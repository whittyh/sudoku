# sudoku
my first sudoku app

download and extract the zipfile and build the project in android studio.  No special 
instructions.  Requires API level 24 or above for correct functionality
WIP, some parts dont work yet, some things are unused. App is targetted to 
Pixel XL API 28 but anything above 24 should be fine.
